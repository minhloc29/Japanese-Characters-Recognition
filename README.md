## **Overview**
Japanese Character Recognition is a deep learning project focused on recognizing ancient Japanese characters, such as Kanji and Hiragana, from historical texts and manuscripts. The project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify these characters from images, even when they are degraded or distorted. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced preprocessing techniques, this system helps automate the digitization of valuable cultural heritage, enabling easier analysis and preservation of ancient Japanese writings.

## **Dataset**
This project uses datasets containing thousands of handwritten and printed Japanese pages from Kaggle.
